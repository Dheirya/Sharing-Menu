# Sharing-Menu
A simple sharing menu like medium built in vanilla js. Only 6KB in size! 

# Demo
You can see it in action on our website: https://socialrumbles.com/home/. Try highlighting a piece of text and you will see a popup like this:

The first button uses the **Social Rumbles** sharing api to share the selected text. The second button copies the text. The third button highlights the text, the fourth button unhighlights it! The fifth button speaks the text using the text-to-speech api. And the last button defines the word by opening a new tab of merriam webster dictionary.

# Usage

You can just include this by using jsdelivr:
```
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Dheirya/Sharing-Menu@1.2.3/sharemenu.js"></script>
```
If you use cloudflare you can also include the app using the apps menu.

# Future

We may add more features in the future, such as more sharing buttons and we might give the users more control over the sharing buttons. We might also try to make it work on mobile devices, if it gets enough positive reception.
